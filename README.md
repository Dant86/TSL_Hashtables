# TSL_Hashtables
Implements hash tables in C, so...

account.c: initializes an account struct, and has withdraw, deposit, and print functions

hashtable.c: initializes a hashtable, which has a number of functions necessary for adding, removing, and editing k/v pairs

tsl.c: helper functions to link account and hashtable together, also making them more user friendly

main.c: IN PROGRESS! Handles user input and saves/loads state of hashtables.
